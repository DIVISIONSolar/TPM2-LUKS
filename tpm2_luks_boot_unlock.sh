# Full disk encryption on Linux using a LUKS key stored in a TPM2 device
#
# Use at your own risk!  I have tried to make this safe and generalized, but
# I make no guarantees it will work or be safe on your system, and take no
# responsibility for any damages or losses incurred from this.
#
# Based on the excellent work by etzion at

# This script alone is not enough to protect your system!  At a minimum, you
# should also set a BIOS password and disable USB booting.  See etzion's
